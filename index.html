      <h1>Dice Duel</h1>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Reduce your opponent’s health points to 0.</p>
    </header>

    <section id="components">
      <h2>Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Standard 52-card deck</li>
        <li>Set of DnD dice (d4, d6, d8, 2d10, d12, d20)</li>
        <li>Health tokens (each player starts with 20 health; maximum health is 20)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="setup">
      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deck and Hand:</strong> Each player shuffles the deck and draws 5 cards to form their initial hand.</li>
        <li><strong>Health:</strong> Each player starts with 20 health points.</li>
        <li><strong>Turn Order:</strong> Decide who goes first by each rolling a d20; the highest roll goes first (reroll on a tie).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="turn-structure">
      <h2>Turn Structure</h2>
      <p>Each turn consists of two phases:</p>
      <h3>1. Duel Phase</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Play a Card:</strong> Both players choose one card from their hand and place it face-down.</li>
        <li><strong>Reveal & Resolve:</strong> Once both cards are set, reveal them simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Simultaneous Damage & Defense:</strong> If one or both revealed cards have attack (Clubs) or defense (Spades) effects, roll their respective dice at the same time. Then, subtract the defense roll from the damage roll before applying any damage. If the defense is equal to or exceeds the damage, no damage is dealt.</li>
        <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Any healing effects resolve after damage effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Effect Resolution:</strong> Resolve each card’s effect based on its suit and rank (see Card Effects below).</li>
        <li><strong>Discard:</strong> After resolving effects, the played cards are moved to a discard pile.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2. Draw Phase</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Replenish Hand:</strong> Each player draws cards from the deck until they have 5 cards in hand.</li>
        <li>If a player already has 5 or more cards, they do not draw.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Refresh Deck:</strong> If the deck is empty, reshuffle it into a new deck.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Repeat the above turn phases until one player’s health is reduced to 0.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Healing Cap:</strong> A player’s health cannot exceed 20.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution Order:</strong> When the played cards in the Duel Phase have both healing and damaging effects, the damaging effect is applied first.</li>
        <li><strong>Game End:</strong> The game ends immediately when one player's health reaches 0. That player loses, and the opponent wins.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional 1 Joker:</strong> If you desire a flair of whimsy, add 1 Joker to each deck. When a Joker is played, choose a face card (excluding Aces) from any suit and resolve its effect.</li>
